I am just starting to learn front-end development. I make it my goal to become results-oriented front-end developer and to build products with the user in mind,
creating websites and web applications with a useable and intuitive user interface experience. I also understand the importance of creating highly readable and easily maintainable source code.
I am striving to learn new technologies and look to ways to better myself in this rapidly changing industry.
